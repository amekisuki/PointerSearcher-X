## How to use ?

This project provides a simple command line program example, the simplest usage:

```shell
ptrscan scan_pointer_chain use_process --pid 123 --addr-list 0x1234567 --depth 4 --range 0:3000
```

For more advanced usage, please refer to `ptrscan --help`

It is strongly recommended that you create your own pointer scanner using [libptrsx.h](https://github.com/kekeimiku/PointerSearcher-X/blob/main/libptrscan/libptrsx.h) for maximum flexibility.
